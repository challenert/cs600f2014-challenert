We present our system for processing per-test coverage data for Java
programs and producing suspiciousness ranking information, including
a detailed explanation of our implementation.  We discuss topics such as
automatic fault localization, coverage monitoring, and mutation testing
as it pertains to the project.  We present preliminary data demonstrating
the effectiveness of the system in use with real world applications, with
comparison data for the EXAM score of several risk evaluation functions.
Finally, we conclude with a summary of our results and a listing of 
possible directions for future work.
